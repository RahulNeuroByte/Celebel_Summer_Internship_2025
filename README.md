**Duration**: 2 Months
**Domain**: Data Science

# Repository Overview
This repository contains weekly assignments and tasks completed during my 2-months Data Science internship at Celebel Technology Pvt. Ltd. (2025).

Each folder represents work done in a specific week, covering Python with oops concept, data preprocessing, EDA, machine learning and Gen AI fundamentals

# Week 1: Introduction to Python
Basic Python, Syntax, Data types, Conditional Statements, Error Handling, Functions, Importing Modules and Creating Customize Modules 

# Week 2: Object Oriented Programming in Python
OOPs concepts including Classes and Objects, Inheritance and polymorphism, Encapsulation, Special methods, Opening, reading and writing to files, Working with CSV and JSON files, Virtual environment creations, pip, pip freeze, Flask web framework, and Django web framework.

# Week 3: Data Science with Python
we focused on core data science tools using Python, including NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. We explored the basics of Machine Learning, matrix operations, and essential statistical concepts like hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and Bayesian inference. We also learned data preprocessing techniques such as cleaning, encoding, scaling, and handling missing values. These concepts were applied in a practical project, where we analyzed and visualized Netflix data to uncover trends in genres, ratings, duration, and regional content preferences.

# Week 4: Feature Engineering
Learned about transforming raw data into meaningful inputs for machine learning models. It covers essential techniques like feature selection, extraction, encoding, and dimensionality reduction methods such as PCA, LDA, t-SNE, and autoencoders. The week also introduces model selection strategies including train-test split, cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search and Random Search. Lastly, it dives into key evaluation metrics for both classification (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC) and regression (MSE, RMSE, R-squared) to assess model performance effectively.

# Week 5 : Regression
Learned about Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, ElasticNet Regression, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines

# Week 6:  Clustering
Focusing on the key concepts of K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN, Gaussian Mixture ModelsBagging, Boosting, Stacking, Random Forest, Gradient BoostingL1 Regularization, L2 Regularization, ElasticNet Regularization
